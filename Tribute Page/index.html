              including agitation, protests, curfews, police firings and
              casualties. The central government finally gave in and on February
              22, 1969, Mujib and others were released. He received public
              acclamation as ‘Bangabandhu’ on February 23 in a mass reception.

            <li>
              <strong>1970</strong> - Although ‘Awami League’ won the democratic
              election of Pakistan with an absolute majority under his
              leadership, the party was not invited to form government.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1971</strong> - Mass protests against such discrimination
              followed and a civil disobedience movement was initiated by Mujib
              who called for independence of Bangladesh. ‘Operation Searchlight’
              was conducted by Pakistan Army and Mujib was arrested and moved to
              West Pakistan. The ‘Bangladesh Liberation War’ followed and
              Pakistan had to surrender to Bangladesh-India Allied Forces.
            </li>
            <li>

              London, addressed international media, went to India to meet
              Indian President Varahagiri Venkata Giri and Prime Minister Indira
              Gandhi and other cabinet members and then came back to Dhaka where
              he received a heart warming welcome. <br />
              He first became the President of the provisional government of
              Bangladesh and later took charge as the Prime Minister. The
              after-effect of rampage posed by the army of Pakistan witnessed
              the young Bangladesh in the middle of carnage in every way. The
              Bangladeshi army was gradually formed. Rigorous rehabilitation and
              other measures to bring the nation into normalcy were undertaken.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1974</strong> - Gradually the nation recovered with Mujib
              playing a prominent role but the disastrous famine of Bangladesh
              including other national issues infused dissent against his
              government. He was accused of nepotism while political and social
              unrest continued resulting in an upsurge in violence. He was
              blamed for killing forty thousand people by his ‘Rakkhi Bahini’.
              Finally an emergency was declared.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>August 15, 1975</strong> - Mujib and most of his family
              members were assassinated in a military coup initiated by
              treacherous army men and discontented members of ‘Awami League’.
              Daughters of Mujib however escaped the murder plot as they were in
              Germany.
            </li>

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              "Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, shortened as Sheikh Mujib or just Mujib,
              was a Bangladeshi politician and statesman. He is the founding
              father of the People's Republic of Bangladesh."
